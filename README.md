# voyage-segmentation-based-on-K-means-algorithm
## AwesomeProject
This project uses the navigation data of a bulk carrier to divide the ship's navigation segments using the K-means algorithm, providing a solution for optimizing the ship's energy efficiency by reasonably reducing the optimization frequency and considering the impact of sea conditions on energy consumption.
## Features
✅ Provide a dataset of bulk carrier voyage data for open-source use
✅ Classify sea conditions based on wind direction, wind speed, and current velocity from the voyage data
✅ Determine the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method
✅ Segment the vessel’s voyage based on the established sea condition classification
